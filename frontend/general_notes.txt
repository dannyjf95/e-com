understanding outet:
   - outlet renders child routes when it has mathced path from the router within the parents routes

example account/orders
    - Account is the layout and orders area child within, also in the router the orders are children of the outer account route tag (see below)
    <Account> 
        <Orders/> 
    </Account>
    outlet here is <Orders/>

    - so when a parent is rendered/loaded outlet gets given the child element that matches the path to the parents path
